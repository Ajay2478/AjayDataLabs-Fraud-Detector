## 📌 Project Overview
Traditional fraud detection systems run in batches (overnight), allowing fraudsters to drain accounts before they are caught. 
**This project is a Real-Time Anomaly Detection Engine** that processes financial transactions in milliseconds, flagging suspicious activity instantly.

It simulates a live payment gateway, scores transactions using an **Isolation Forest** machine learning model, and visualizes threats on a live dashboard.
